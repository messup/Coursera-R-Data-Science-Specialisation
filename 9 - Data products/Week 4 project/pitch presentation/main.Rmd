## Introduction

This shiny web app is intended to allow a user to visualise the relationship between fuel effiency and other variables present in the mtcars dataset. 

The user is able to:

* Select which variable to plot on the *x*-axis using a dropdown box.
* Choose whether to visualise data from vehicles with manual tranmissions or from those with automatic tranmissions.

## Introduction to the `mtcars` dataset
The following information is taken from the `mtcars` help file:

>The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

To confirm this is the case, we may check that there are 11 features and 32 observations:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data(mtcars)
message("Total number of features:", ncol(mtcars))
message("Total number of observations:", nrow(mtcars))
```


## Histogram of fuel efficiencies

This plot shows the distribution of fuel efficiencies present in the `mtcars` dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(x=mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2, fill='red')
```


##Available *x* variables

The following variables are available to plot on the *x* axis:

| Field  | Detail                 |
| -----  | ------                 |
| `cyl`  | Number of cylinders    |
| `disp` | Displacement (cu.in.)  |
| `hp`   | Gross horsepower       |
| `drat` | Rear axle ratio        |
| `wt`   | Weight (lb/1000)       |
| `qsec` | 1/4 mile time          |
| `vs`   | V/S                    |
| `gear` | Number of forward gears|
| `carb` | Number of carburetors  |
